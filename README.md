# HTML5 Canvas
 
A lesson to learn basic canvas features and create a vanilla JavaScript logic for drawing on mouse down.

We can draw on a 2d context of a window-wide canvas element.

The draw function runs exclusively when mouse is down and also moving.

One can not draw on mouse up and mouse out.

Additional features are change of the hue with every draw, and change of line width under certain conditions.
